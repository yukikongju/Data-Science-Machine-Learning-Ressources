# Cycle GAN Notes


- Conv2D
    * padding_mode: how padding values are assigned
	+ zeros: add 0 around image
	    + Ex: [1, 2, 3] => [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]
	+ reflect: reflect input along the edges, excluding edge value
	    + Ex: [1, 2, 3] => [2, 1, 2, 3, 2]
	    + use case: image processing, avoiding artificial edges
	+ replicated: reflect input along the edges
	    + Ex: [1, 2, 3] => [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]
	    + use case: when border information is constant
	+ circular: wrapping left/right, up/down
	    + Ex: [1, 2, 3] => [3, 1, 2, 3, 1]
	    + use case: when boundaries are periodic
- Discriminator
    * uses leaky relu, trading training speed for stability 
    * first conv layer is not normalized because:
	+ normalizing latent variable generated by generator removes 
	  variance, leading to mode collapse and making the generator less 
	  diverse
- Generator
    * unlike GAN, uses an image (B, 3, 256, 256) to generate fake image instead 
      of noise vector (B, 1, 1, 1)
    * the first and last convolution layer keep the feature map the same size 
      and only change the number of channel to match the number of feature map 
      needed
