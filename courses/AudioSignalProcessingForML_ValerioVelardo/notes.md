## Lecture 2 - Sound and Waveforms

- Summary: understand that sound is a waveform that has frequency, intesity and 
  timbre, which affects the way we perceive sound

**Notes**

- sound is a mechanical wave
- waveform give us information on frequency, intensity, timbre
- periodic (simple vs complex) vs aperiodic sound (continuous vs transient)
- amplitude (A) (measure amount of pertubation) vs frequency (f) in Hertz vs phase (phi)
- higher frequency = higher sound; larger amplitude = louder; 
- hearing range for humans (20-20,000 Hz) until ultrasounds
- what is pitch? logarithmic perception of frequencies
    * 2 frequencies are perceived similarly if they differ by a power of 2 (octave)
- midi notes
    * semi-tones (12 semi-tones in octave) and cents (1200 cents in octave)
    * formula to map pitch to frequency: $F(p) = 2^((p-69)/12) * 440$
    * relationship between different pitches

**Questions**

- [ ] What is sound?
- [ ] What information can we extract from sound? how do we interpret them?
- [ ] What frequencies do humans perceive?
- [ ] How many semi-tones in a octave? How many cents in an octave?
- [ ] How human perceive frequency and cents?


## Lecture 3 - Intensity, Loudness and Timbre

- Summary: Sound can be descrbie with their intensity (objective measure), 
  loudness (subjective measure) and their timbre (color of sound). We can use 
  signal carrier to modify frequency and amplitude modulation.

**Intensity**

- threshold of hearing: (10e-12) W/m^2
- threshold of pain: (10 W/m^2)
- Perforation of eardrum: 10e4
- range of intensity: threshold of hearing , threshold pain
- every increase of 3 dB, intensity doubles

**Loudness**

- sound intensity 
- loudness depends on duration and frequency (and age). measured in phons

**Timbre**

- timbre: color of sound; difference between two sound with same intensity, frequency and duration (ex: piano vs violin)
- timbre is multidimensional
- harmonic partial = freq * 2 with half intensity
- reading a spectogram for violin and piano
- frequency modulation = vibrato
- amplitude modulation = tremolo

**Questions**

- [ ] What is sound intensity
- [ ] What is the range of intensity
- [ ] How do we create an intensity level? Level of reference
- [ ] why do we say intensity is an objective measure of sound whilst loudness is 
      a subjective measure of sound ? What is their unit measure
- [ ] why do we say timbre is the color of sound?
- [ ] what is sound enveloppe? (attack-decay-sustain-release model). For piano vs violin
- [ ] What is a harmonic partial? how can we find it on a spectrogram
- [ ] How carrier signal is used modulate frequency and amplitude?
