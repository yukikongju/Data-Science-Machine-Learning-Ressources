## Homework

- [X] Homework 1 - Chicago and Neighbors 

  - Using simple linear regression and KNN on time and temperature
  - Understanding that linear regression assumptions need to be valid 
    to use model for hypothesis testing and prediction
  - Understanding that KNN can capture non-linear data where as linear regression 
    can't
  - we can compare model performance by computing their mean squared error
