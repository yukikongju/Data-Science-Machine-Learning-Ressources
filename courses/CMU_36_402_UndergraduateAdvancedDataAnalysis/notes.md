## Notes

**HW1**

- Using simple linear regression and KNN on time and temperature
- Understanding that linear regression assumptions need to be valid 
to use model for hypothesis testing and prediction
- Understanding that KNN can capture non-linear data where as linear regression 
can't
- we can compare model performance by computing their mean squared error
