## CMU 36-520: Data Mining

This course focus on clustering and dimension reduction methods 
to extract information from large bodies of data. The subjects discussed are:
- Searching by similarity and distance
- Information and Uncertainty
- Clustering
- Data Reduction and Feature Enhancement using factor analysis, linear and non-linear dimension reduction
- Multiple Linear Regression Review
- Prediction by combining predictive models (linear classifiers, logistic regression, ...)
- Classification using the kernel trick and multiple testing; profiling
- Estimating causal impact without experiments


The lecture notes for 2009 are slightly more complete than the 2008 
version. However, the homework and assignment are different.
