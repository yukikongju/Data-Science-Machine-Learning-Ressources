# Chap 6 - Using a Neural Network to fit the data

[Code](https://github.com/deep-learning-with-pytorch/dlwpt-code/tree/master/p1ch6)

- [X] Neural network: coding a neural network with our own model and loss function
- [ ] Activation Function: plotting the activation function
- [ ] NN Module: using pytorch nn module class

The activation function must be: 
    1. be differentiable
    2. non-linear
