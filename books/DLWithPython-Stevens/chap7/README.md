# Chap 7 - Telling birds from airplanes: learning from images

- [X] Transforms: using torchvision transforms to modify the picture
    - [X] view image generated from random tensor
- [ ] DataLoader:

**Notes**
- we use LogSoftMax() instead of SoftMax() because it handles probability 
  close to zero better
