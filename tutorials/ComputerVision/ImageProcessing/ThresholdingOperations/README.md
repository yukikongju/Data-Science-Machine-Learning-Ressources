# Thresholding Operations

We use thresholding operations to convert grayscale image to binary image ie each pixel is either classified as background or foreground.

**Types of Thresholding Operations**

- Simple Thresholding: This is the basic form of thresholding where each pixel's intensity is compared to a fixed threshold value. If the intensity is above the threshold, it's set to the maximum value (usually 255 for an 8-bit image), otherwise, it's set to 0.
- Adaptive Thresholding: In this method, the threshold value is not fixed for the entire image, but it's determined locally based on the characteristics of the surrounding pixels. This is particularly useful for images with varying lighting conditions.
- Otsu's Thresholding: Otsu's method automatically calculates an "optimal" threshold that separates the foreground and background by minimizing the intra-class variance.
- Multi-Level Thresholding: This approach involves dividing the image into multiple segments based on multiple threshold values. It's used for segmenting images with multiple regions of interest.
- Color Thresholding: Thresholding can also be applied to color images by setting thresholds for each channel (Red, Green, Blue) or other color spaces (e.g., HSV or LAB).


**Projects with Thresholding Operations**

- Object Detection: Thresholding can be used to separate objects from the background, making it easier to detect and analyze objects in an image. This is particularly useful in applications like counting cells in a microscope image.
- Image Segmentation: Thresholding is often used to segment images into meaningful regions. For example, you can use thresholding to separate foreground objects from the background in satellite imagery.
- Document Analysis: Thresholding can be used to extract text from documents by separating the ink (foreground) from the paper (background).
- Biomedical Imaging: In medical imaging, thresholding can be used to identify and segment specific structures or tissues of interest in X-ray, MRI, or CT scans.
- Quality Control: In manufacturing, thresholding can be applied to images of products to check for defects or deviations from the standard.
- Character Recognition: In OCR (Optical Character Recognition), thresholding can help extract text characters from scanned documents or images.
- Lane Detection in Autonomous Vehicles: Thresholding can be used to detect lane markings on roads in images captured by autonomous vehicles.
